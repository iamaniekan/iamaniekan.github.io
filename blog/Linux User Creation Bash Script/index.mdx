This is the DevOps Stage one task of the [HNG Internship](https://hng.tech/internship). The Internship has been challenging so far. You can learn more about HNG Internship [here](https://hng.tech/premium).

Let's get into the task and review my solution.

# Task
Your company has employed many new developers. As a SysOps engineer, write a bash script called `create_users.sh` that reads a text file containing the employeeâ€™s usernames and group names, where each line is formatted as `user;groups`.
The script should create users and groups as specified, set up home directories with appropriate permissions and ownership, generate random passwords for the users, and log all actions to `/var/log/user_management.log`. Additionally, store the generated passwords securely in `/var/secure/user_passwords.txt`.
Ensure error handling for scenarios like existing users and provide clear documentation and comments within the script.

---

### Requirements:
- Each User must have a personal group with the same group name as the username, this group name will not be written in the text file.
- A user can have multiple groups, each group delimited by comma ","
- Usernames and user groups are separated by semicolon ";"- Ignore whitespace

e.g.
```bash
light; sudo,dev,www-data
idimma; sudo
mayowa; dev,www-data
```
For the first line, light is username and groups are sudo, dev, www-data

# My Solution
To get optimal solution to the task, we need to understand what is required to be done. Here is a brief summary outlining what needs to be done.

---

- Create a file named `create_user.sh`.
- Create an input file containing employee username and group names formatted as `user;group`.
- Extract the username and groups.
- Create the user and the groups.
- Set up home directories with appropriate permissions and ownership.
- Generate random password for the users.
- Log all actions to `/var/log/user_management.log`.
- Store the generated passwords securely in `/var/secure/user_passwords.txt`.
- Handle errors for scenarios like existing users.

---

Now let's create the file and write a script implementing the functional requirements highlighted above.

I would explain each part of the script, highlighting the key functions and commands used. You can get the full implementation [HERE](https://github.com/iamaniekan/bash-task).

### Shebang
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
 This is the shebang line, indicating that the script should be executed using the Bash shell. This ensures the script runs in a bash environment, which is necessary for the syntax and commands used.

### Define Log and Password File Paths
```bash
LOG_FILE="/var/log/user_management.log"
PASSWORD_FILE="/var/secure/user_passwords.csv"
```
These lines define the paths for the log file and the password file. Using variables for these paths makes the script more readable and easier to maintain.

### Log Message Function
```bash
log_message() {
    MESSAGE=$1
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') : $MESSAGE" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}
```
This function logs messages to the log file with a timestamp. It takes a single argument (`$1`), the message to be logged, and appends it to the log file with a formatted date and time.

### Setup Files Function
```bash
setup_files() {
    touch "$LOG_FILE" "$PASSWORD_FILE"
    chmod 600 "$PASSWORD_FILE"
    log_message "Script started"
}
```
This function ensures the necessary files exist and have the correct permissions. 
  - `touch` creates the files if they do not exist.
  - `chmod 600` sets the password file to be readable and writable only by the file owner, ensuring security.
  - `log_message "Script started"` logs the start of the script.

### Check Input File Function
```bash
check_input_file() {
    if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
        log_message "No input file provided"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    INPUT_FILE="$1"
    
    if [[ ! -f "$INPUT_FILE" ]]; then
        log_message "Input file does not exist: $INPUT_FILE"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```
This function checks if an input file is provided and if it exists.
  - `[[ -z "$1" ]]`: Checks if the first argument is empty.
  - `[[ ! -f "$INPUT_FILE" ]]`: Checks if the specified file does not exist.
  - Logs appropriate messages and exits with a status code of `1` if checks fail.

### Sanitize Input Function
```bash
sanitize_input() {
    INPUT="$1"
    echo "$INPUT" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9,;]//g'
}
```
This function sanitizes the input to remove any characters that are not alphanumeric, commas, or semicolons. This is important for security and to ensure the script processes input correctly.

### Create User and Groups Function
```bash
create_user_and_groups() {
     USERNAME="$1"
     GROUPS="$2"
    
    if id "$USERNAME" &>/dev/null; then
        log_message "User $USERNAME already exists"
        return
    fi
    
    useradd -m -s /bin/bash "$USERNAME"
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        log_message "Failed to create user $USERNAME"
        return
    fi
    log_message "Created user $USERNAME"
    
    groupadd "$USERNAME"
    usermod -aG "$USERNAME" "$USERNAME"
    
    IFS=',' read -ra GROUP_LIST <<< "$GROUPS"
    for group in "${GROUP_LIST[@]}"; do
        group=$(echo "$group" | xargs)
        if ! getent group "$group" &>/dev/null; then
            groupadd "$group"
        fi
        usermod -aG "$group" "$USERNAME"
    done
    
    generate_password "$USERNAME"
}
```

  - `USERNAME="$1"` and `GROUPS="$2"`: Assign the first and second arguments to `USERNAME` and `GROUPS`.
  - `if id "$USERNAME" &>/dev/null; then ... fi`: Check if the user already exists, and log a message if so.
  - `useradd -m -s /bin/bash "$USERNAME"`: Create the user with a home directory and set the default shell to Bash.
  - `groupadd "$USERNAME"` and `usermod -aG "$USERNAME" "$USERNAME"`: Create a personal group for the user and add the user to it.
  - `IFS=',' read -ra GROUP_LIST <<< "$GROUPS"`: Split the groups by comma into an array.
  - The `for` loop processes each group, creating it if it does not exist and adding the user to it.
  - `generate_password "$USERNAME"`: Call the function to generate and set a random password for the user.

### Generate Password Function
```bash
generate_password() {
    USERNAME="$1"
    PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 12)
    echo "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" | chpasswd

    echo "$USERNAME,$PASSWORD" >> "$PASSWORD_FILE"
    chmod 600 "$PASSWORD_FILE"
    log_message "Password setup for $USERNAME is successful"
}
```

  - `USERNAME="$1"`: Assign the first argument to `USERNAME`.
  - `PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 12)`: Generate a random password with 12 alphanumeric characters.
  - `echo "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" | chpasswd`: Set the password for the user.
  - `echo "$USERNAME,$PASSWORD" >> "$PASSWORD_FILE"`: Append the username and password to the password file.
  - `chmod 600 "$PASSWORD_FILE"`: Ensure the password file has the correct permissions.
  - `log_message "Password setup for $USERNAME is successful"`: Log a success message.

### Process File Function
```bash
process_file() {
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        [[ -z "$line" ]] && continue
        line=$(sanitize_input "$line")
        USERNAME=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ';' -f 1)
        GROUPS=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ';' -f 2)
        create_user_and_groups "$USERNAME" "$GROUPS" &
    done < "$INPUT_FILE"
    wait
}
```

  - `while IFS= read -r line; do ... done < "$INPUT_FILE"`: Read the input file line by line.
  - `[[ -z "$line" ]] && continue`: Skip empty lines.
  - `line=$(sanitize_input "$line")`: Sanitize the input line.
  - `USERNAME=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ';' -f 1)` and `GROUPS=$(echo "$line" | cut -d ';' -f 2)`: Extract the username and groups.
  - `create_user_and_groups "$USERNAME" "$GROUPS" &`: Create the user and groups in the background.
  - `wait`: Wait for all background processes to finish.

### Main Function
```bash
main() {
    setup_files
    check_input_file "$1"
    process_file
    log_message "Script ended"
}
```

  - `setup_files`: Prepare the log and password files.
  - `check_input_file "$1"`: Validate the input file provided as the first argument.
  - `process_file`: Process the input file to create users and groups.
  - `log_message "Script ended"`: Log the end of the script.

### Run the Main Function
```bash
main "$1"
```
Call the `main` function with the first argument passed to the script, orchestrating the entire process.

### Conclusion
- The script is designed to be modular, with clear separation of concerns for each task (logging, file setup, user creation, etc.).
- Error handling and logging are implemented to ensure smooth operation and easy troubleshooting.
- Permissions and security considerations are addressed, especially for the password file.
