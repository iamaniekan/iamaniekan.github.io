I can imagine your curiosity piqued about how on earth truths and prime numbers could be related. But bear with me for a moment, since this analogy is possibly going to open up a new dimension of thought for you.

For those who might need a refresher since elementary school, prime numbers are numbers divisible only by one and themselves. They can’t be divided down into simpler factors without losing their prime status. What does that have to do with truth?

When we consider reality from the viewpoint of a prime number, truth starts to resemble a prime number rather than the other way around. Now, let’s examine two specific components that characterize a prime number: **“one”** and **“itself”**. According to this viewpoint, something must be whole (one) and validated by itself in order to be regarded as truth. The same is true for prime numbers: truth is true independently of everything else. It just is.

### **What Does That Mean for Truth?**

It means that truth is an independent entity; it does not depend on any outer confirmation or endorsement to establish its nature. Just as a prime number, which cannot be divided without losing its primary quality, the truth also cannot be changed or analyzed without damaging its essential character.

Truth is truth—not because you happen to like or not like it. It does not change just because your feelings about it do. You may refuse to accept 7 as a prime number; that does not make it any less of one. In finding the truth about something, we must search for the truth in the thing itself.

### **Truth in Human Identity**

Let me give you an illustration. Picture a man standing right in front of you. All his physical features, such as his biological structure, physical appearance, and genetics determining him to be male, are those things that present him as a man. He is a man, and the real features prove it. Now, along comes a person who chooses to believe he is a woman, for whatever reason. Does the fact change because of that? Negative. No matter what he thinks, the man is still a man. The belief is incomplete because it cannot substantiate itself.

This example also shows the independence of truth. Just like a prime number, the truth remains constant and intact, irrespective of what other people may think or believe.


### **Truth in Nature**


Here’s another scenario. Visualize a tree for a second. A tree is characterized by its roots, its trunk, its leaves, and its branches. The actuality of the tree’s being is in its whole form as a tree. Now, when someone sees that tree and decides to call it something else, say a rock or a bag, their belief in that name doesn’t change its real existence. It’s still a tree. There’s your truth in its rawest form—complete and self-validated.

Truth, like a prime number, doesn’t shift to accommodate perception. The prime number is a prime number, even when not acknowledged. In like manner, the tree retains its trueness to life irrespective of whatever perception by the others.

### **Truth in Science**

Now, for a minute, let’s jump into science. Consider gravity. Gravity is a universal law—a truth that works independently of whether we do or do not believe in it. If someone were to deny gravity, that would not make it disappear. Objects would still fall. Its truth, like that of a prime number, is self-contained and undeniable.

This is another layer of the same idea: truths in the natural world are like prime numbers—they don’t need anything outside of themselves to validate their existence. They exist unto themselves, are complete, and are whole.

What can we conclude from this? The truth, just like the prime number, is integral, discrete, and indivisible. Truth is not a factor of belief or perception, and truth does not depend on what is outside itself in order to be valid. The truth, just like prime numbers, simply exists as it is.

In a world just full of misinformation, half-truths, and slanted interpretations, it’s easy to get confused about the true state of reality. But thinking about truth as something akin to prime numbers nudges us to aspire towards the evident, intact, and complete. There is no need for agreement as to whether prime numbers are or are not; their existence depends on no ratification.

### 📌**Call to Action**

Here’s a challenge for you: Make it a point to seek the “prime” truths in your everyday life. Ask yourself this: **“Is this truth whole and complete in itself, or does it rely on something else for validation?”**

Seek the truths that validate themselves. Look for the truth in relationships, work, your understanding of the world, and your views on reality. Truth does not require endorsement; it only has to be discovered.
